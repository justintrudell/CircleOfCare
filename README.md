# CircleOfCare
CircleOfCare is a web application that aims to help people with MS better coordinate with their care providers. 
The application seeks to do this by allowing patients an intuitive, easy-to-use interface into which they can input various information, 
such as their symptoms and daily exercise routines, which can be viewed and analyzed by their care providers.

The application is currently in development and leverages the Django Web Framework.
